 ## Description
 
 This is a CMS-style blog site similar to Wordpress, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts. This site is built from scratch and deployed to Heroku. This site follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
